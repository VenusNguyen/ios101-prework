## App Brainstorming
1. Spotify
  * Share lyrics
  * Playlist collaboration
2. Instagram
  * Note/Music shared feature (Not the stories but the ones when we open messgaes
3. I want to design an app that allow people to create their family tree
  * A simple and user-friendly UI for adding family members easily
  * Each person should have their little story and maybe their significant milestones through out their life
  * Allow multiple family members to contribute and update the tree
  * Customization options for different tree layouts, colors, and themes
  * Data import/export so they can save and share their family trees
